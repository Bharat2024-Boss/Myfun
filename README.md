# 🚀 KiddoLand AI: Android APK Guide

This repository is set up to automatically build an Android App (.apk) for you!

## How to get your APK file:

1. **Push your code**: Upload these files to your GitHub repository.
2. **Go to "Actions"**: At the top of your GitHub repository page, click the **Actions** tab.
3. **Select Workflow**: On the left, click **"Build Android APK"**.
4. **Find the Build**: Click on the most recent run (usually at the top with a green checkmark).
5. **Download**: Scroll down to the **"Artifacts"** section at the bottom of that page.
6. **Install**: Click on **`kiddoland-android-apk`**. This will download a ZIP file. Inside it is your `.apk` file!
7. **Phone Install**: Copy that `.apk` to your Android phone and open it to install. (You may need to allow "Install from Unknown Sources").

## Requirements for Best Results:
- Ensure you enable **GitHub Pages** in your repository settings (`Settings` > `Pages` > `Source: Deploy from branch`) so the builder can see the live app.
